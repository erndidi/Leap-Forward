 <article>You don't have to be a rocket scientist to appreciate the University of Tennessee Space Institute.<p>
Technology paving the way for more fuel efficient cars, realistic special effects for Hollywood and possible new defenses against bioterrorism have been developed by researchers in this quiet corner of Middle Tennessee. <p>
For Dr. John Caruthers, Chief Operating Officer and Dean for Academic Affairs, it is the people as much as the facilities that have made UTSI what it is today. <p>
"We have individuals from all over the world who are the best in their field working here," Caruthers said. <p>
Unfortunately, this gem has seen better days. Big-money government contracts have dried up, the student population has fallen from a high of 350 to fewer than 100 and legislators, faced with a dwindling state budget, have questioned the importance and feasibility of keeping the institute open. <p>
Few questioned UTSI's importance when it officially opened in 1964, when the country was in the middle of the space race with the Soviet Union. During that decade, UTSI lived up to its name, contributing to mankind's first lunar landing in 1969. <p>
The idea for UTSI actually dates further back to the end of World War II when U.S. officials, after seeing how advanced German aviation was, decided that the United States needed to do something similar. <p>
"It was really scary," Caruthers said. "The Germans had developed their theories and practical applications of supersonic flight to the point where, if they had waited a few years before starting the war ... we would have been in big trouble." <p>
According to Caruthers, the Nazis succeeded in part because of the way they placed manufacturing centers close to technical schools, allowing professors and advanced students to apply their research quickly to a manufacturing environment. The famous aerodynamist, Theodore von Karman, recommended that the U.S. should build facilities to expand upon Nazi research and to associate those facilities with a university. <p>
In 1964, UTSI began operation under the directorship of B.H. Goethert, a German scientist who worked under the Nazis during World War II. During the Cold War, UTSI assisted the Air Engineering Development Corporation in testing and developing aircraft and spacecraft design. <p>
After the Berlin Wall fell, defense funding began to dry up and UTSI researchers started looking for civilian applications for UTSI research. <p>
The civilian applications included methods for making better metal alloys to finding ways to make a softball travel faster and farther. <p>
Biophysics is where some of the most exciting work is being done today. According to Caruthers, a UTSI researcher has developed a device that uses short laser bursts to read the genetic code of an individual. Such a device would be extremely useful in medicine, Caruthers said. <p>
"We would have the entire code of a person. If someone were to walk into a doctor's office for a blood test ... we might be able to say to that person 'Man, if you live to this age, you will have a genetic predisposition for this or that. But if you address it now, you will have no problem.'"<p>
UTSI research has even made it onto the silver screen. Recently, Hollywood has used UTSI researcher Dr. John Steinhoff's groundbreaking work in air flow modeling. Originally, Steinhoff's work was directed towards helping aircraft designers eliminate the whirlwind vortexes that form behind jet airplanes in flight. Steinhoff took the same technology that he used to model air flow around helicopter blades and aircraft wings, and applied it towards a problem area in the special effects world - creating realistic smoke. 	<p>
	People doing computer generated special effects are not physicists and the smoke they create looks more like a blob than a column of smoke, Steinhoff said. The producers of Jurassic Park III and The Mummy Returns used Steinhoff's methods to create smoke-filled scenes.<p>
UTSI's success relies on its ability to produce cutting-edge research. But such research requires two things: money and talent. And for years, UTSI has been running low on both, especially after losing a major NASA contract several years ago. <p>
"Losing the NASA contract hurt," Caruthers said. <p>
As a result of having less money, he has had to make lots of changes. <p>
"I've consolidated positions ... had to let some staff and non tenured faculty go." <p>
According to Caruthers, the area where the lack of money really hurts is in attracting more talent. <p>
"We don't have the money to invest in young new professors. UTSI has many professors who are tenured and close to retirement," Caruthers said. <p>
Most of these professors are very experienced in the subjects they teach, but they don't necessarily produce the kind of research that attracts funding. <p>
"A lot of the professors here work in traditional aerodynamics," Caruthers said. "We need younger professors doing research in more cutting edge research ... in space technology and health physics, for instance." <p>
Caruthers believes that most of UTSI funding problems can be solved. He envisions a "cooperative" environment where UTSI will take on research oriented faculty and graduate students who will work under them. Graduate students who need classes at UT proper can take those classes via television or the Internet, eliminating the need to move professors not directly involved in institute research to the campus. <p>
At the present the future of UTSI is unclear. <p>
Dr. John Prados, a professor in the College of Engineering, is chairing a committee looking into the future of UTSI. <p>
Prados said that the committee is in the information gathering stage at the moment. <p>
"At this point in time, we haven't even formulated the recommendations ... but my guess is that there would have to be some consolidations and shifting of personnel."<p>
But according to Dr. Loren Crabtree, provost and vice president for Academic Affairs and the person who the committee is reporting to, "All options are open ... We will work with the UTSI leadership to make it a more viable institution." <p>
Like Prados, Crabtree is waiting on the committee to make its recommendations. <p>
"We'll see where it takes us," Crabtree said. <p>
Caruthers remains optimistic on future of UTSI. <p>
"We have the opportunity to do something very special ... and build a renowned institution ... I'm looking to take advantage of that," Caruthers said.</div>
