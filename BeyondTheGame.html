There's more to University of Tennessee football than 22 guys dressed in helmets and pads, half of them dressed in orange and white, charging into one another. Football also includes cheerleaders, hours before the game, lining up in the bright autumn sun; band members fingering their instruments; bored gatekeepers, waiting for a ticket to tear and kids throwing pompoms at one another.
           In More than the Game, Robert Heller, UT Professor of photojournalism, captured life around the playing field that is in many ways just as vivid as the game itself.
"I was always fascinated with the pageantry in all the major aspects of college football," Heller said.
Heller pursued that interest here at UT where the school extended Heller the courtesy of a field pass and allowed him to photograph whatever he wanted.
        "I found that over the 15 years that I've been here, I've built up quite a collection of photographs that I believe are rather unique," he said. Heller estimates that for More than the Game he took between 5,000 and 7,000 pictures and from those, less than 150 made it into the book.
As to what criteria used to judge the pictures, Heller said, "I look at the composition of the photograph, the color, the point of view. I chose those pictures which were visually compelling to me...anything that might make a good picture is what I am interested in," Heller said. 
         More than the Game was not true photojournalism in the sense that it focused solely on the experiences of the people and events the photos displayed. 
         "It was my interpretation as an artist of the UT football experience," Heller said. "As the title suggests, the book is about everything that surrounds the game."
         Heller's book neatly divides the pictures into eight broad areas - "The Fans," "The Band," "The Cheerleaders," "The Stadium," "The Officials," "The Players," "The Coaches," and, interesting enough, "The Media." With a grin on his face, Heller said that he further subdivided those categories and labeled them with titles not found in the book.
           For instance, Heller unofficially calls pages 48-49 "the yelling page." It shows three individuals in orange, screaming at the action below them. Pages 40-41 is the "face painted page" showing three individuals faces painted in white and orange. 
          Patterns figure predominantly in the book. Indeed, much of Heller's work consists of careful editing as much as it does on photography. "More than the Game is a book of pictures making patterns as much as it is a book of pictures themselves. Whether it was a row of tubas lined up like little a row of mouths waiting to be fed or a row of cheerleaders who each have a big orange "T" painted on the same spot on her face, patterns find their way into the book. 
        "Sometimes it's interesting to have a close-up of one person, but sometimes its interesting to photograph a series of people wearing the same uniform, and kinda what happens to them," Heller said. "I mean, how can you go wrong taking a picture of tubas, they're so interesting, and when you have a row of them they're even more interesting." 
         One of the most interesting features about the book is the way Heller often grouped the photos together so that for attentive readers the photos would take on meanings outside of themselves. 
"I had a chance to not only do the photography and the editing, but the design as well," he said. "That's kinda nice because when you're working with your own work, you want to present it the best way you can." 
Heller went on to point out a number of places where he arranged his photos for a humorous effect. In one part of the book, Heller juxtaposes a picture of the actor David Keith (who, according to Heller, has been granted status as an "honorary coach") dressed as a coach above a picture of coach Phillip Fulmer.In another section there are two pictures of people placed side by side, so as they appear to be looking at one another -- one through a camcorder, the other through a pair of binoculars. Another set of pictures in the "Officials" section shows a picture of an official's cap above the picture of another official's waist which leads to a third picture on the next page of an official's arm. "It's as if what's missing is the face," Heller said. "It's kind of an amusing thing to have fun with," he added.
            When asked how the book was selling, Heller replied "I don't know...the bookstore tells me it's selling well, and that there's a big market for this kind of book." Heller said that he is currently working on making portraits of Holocaust survivors accompanied by handwritten accounts of their experiences.
          When asked what advice he had for emerging photographers interested in publishing their own books, Heller said, "Do your work because you have a passion for your work, not because you're trying sell a book or make money. When you have sizable amount of work that you think there's a market for, put it together in a coherent fashion. Do your research, find someone who might publish your work and send them a proposal. You never know."
