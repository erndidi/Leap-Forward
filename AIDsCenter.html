Hope for AIDS victims lives on the seventh floor of Fort Sanders Medical Center, according to Dr. Jeannie Gillian. "People with AIDS have choices; you either sit down or pick up the baton and start marching," said Gillian, director of services for the Hope Center. <p>
The Hope Center helps people who have found out that they are HIV positive and guides them through the turbulent waters of living with AIDS. The center was established in 1996 following a two year study conducted by Dr. Gillian designed to find out how a group of men and women living with the virus "experienced hope," Gillian said. <p>
The purpose of the center, as expressed in an information packet the center puts out, "is to educate and care for AIDS victims and their families in a professional environment, free from judgment." <p>
It's important to distinguish HIV and AIDS: HIV is the presence of the virus in the body and AIDS refers to the disease when it manifests itself by way of symptoms.<p>
In fact, Gillian rarely uses the word AIDS when describing a patient's condition since more live longer with the disease than with AIDS. "Now we use the term HIV disease - we don't use the word AIDS because we don't know if they have AIDS," she said. "Living with HIV disease is no different than living with cancer, leukemia, heart disease, or diabetes." <p>
Still, life does become more complicated whether one is simply HIV positive or they have the full-blown version of the disease. "Survival skills" are needed, Gillian said. "You need to learn about the illness, and the medical conditions surrounding the illness," Gillian said.<p>
One woman found out how much she had to learn about the disease. "I was a normal person ... I never thought it would happen to us," said Carol Ann McMillan, whose brother, Charles "Chucky" Moyers, died of AIDS after several years of being HIV positive.<p>
According to McMillan, Dr. Gillian did everything from helping the McMillans interact with the myriad doctors and medical professionals the family encountered while Moyers was sick to providing emotional support to Moyers and his family. "Dr. Gillian really comes into play with people when everything is at it's worst," she said. <p>
Other people have given praises to Dr. Gillian, like Jack Moore, a volunteer at the center who is HIV positive. "If you have a question, you call Dr. Gillian. If there's a crisis, you call Dr. Gillian ... Jeannie and the Hope Center - they advocate for their clients," he said. <p>
Despite the fact that people still believe AIDS to be a "gay disease" it isn't. "More heterosexuals, especially women, are affected by it," Gillian said. "That's what the disease does, it catches people off guard. People think that they're not going to catch it because they're not a white gay man, and that's the horror of it because you can't get people to understand that it's a medical problem, it's a public health problem." <p>
Gillian mentioned talking to a young man years ago who had AIDS. "He was athletic, attractive," she said. "He told me that he could have had sex here every night of the week. He said that he asked this girl one time 'Aren't you concerned about getting anything' and she told him 'Why no, you don't look like you would have anything.'" <p>
Gillian said that fortunately the young man, who was gay, never did have sex with any of the girls.<p>
And so given the widespread ignorance of HIV and AIDS on campus and in the community, the center places a lot of emphasis on educating the public about the disease. Gillian herself lectures at UT, and is surprised at how little students know about the subject. <p>
"They don't have a clue," Gillian said. "I have to start from the beginning: 'What is HIV; how do you find out if you have HIV; how long does it take before you get sick? I have to answer all of these basic, high school-type questions."<p>
Along with Gillian's guest lectures, the center hosts workshops, and participates in events that focus on building AIDS and HIV awareness. One big project in particular is the NAMES Project, a quilt built by family members and friends who contribute a panel at a time in memory of a person who succumbed to the disease. <p>
But for Gillian, HIV or AIDS education should be more basic than any event or community workshop. "We teach our kids to look both ways before crossing the street ... we should be teaching them how to have safe sex," Gillian said.<article>
